# Instacart Basket Analysis (Python)

This project was prepared as a part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics Course.

## Project Brief

### Context
The Instacart stakeholdes are most interested in the variety of customers in their database with their purchasing behaviors. They assume then cannot target everyone using the same methods, and they are considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to tardet different customers with applicable marketing campains to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. 

### Key questions
* The sales team need to know  what the busiest days of the week and hours of the dat are (i.e. the days and the times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise as these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency or product orders.
* Are there certain types od products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* The marketign and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of consumers in their system and how their ordering behaviours differ. For example:
	* What is the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e. how often do they return to Instacart)?
	* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
	* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
	* Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
	* What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
	* What differences can be found in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
	
### Data
Open-source data sets from Instacart were used for the project, as well as a customer data set (created by Career Foundry for the purpose of this project).
